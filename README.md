# Starry Night Screensaver

Purpose: serves no purpose, but to entertain.

This is not the work of science, but an object of art. A perfect copy of a
masterpiece once created, but only remembered by few today. You get a unique
chance to experience the same emotions your ancestors experienced when left
their IBM PCs untouched for 5 minutes or so.

An artists impression of the original Norton Commander v4 and v5 Starry Night
screensaver implemented in Go.

## If it serves no purpose, what does it do?

Your terminal or command prompt will go blank, and a bunch of stars will start
to emerge from darkness. You may even find some familiar constellations (ahem)
if you wait long enough.

After a while, some stars will begin to explode, only to give birth to a new
stars in this eternal cycle of life and death. When the last star explodes, you
will know that the world has come to an end, or maybe you pressed any key and
the program terminated. You'll never know.

## Where did this come from?

This hidden gem has been lying around the dusty pile of projects, I thought it
would be such a waste to keep it just to myself, so releasing it to public.
Sharing is caring.

Tested to work on macOS, Windows and Linux.

You're asking too many questions.
